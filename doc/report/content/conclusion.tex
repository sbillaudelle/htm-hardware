Implementing machine intelligence algorithms as spiking neural networks and porting them to a neuromorphic hardware platform presents high demands in terms of precision and scalability.

We have shown in this paper, that \glspl{htm} can be successfully modeled in dynamic simulations. The basic functionality of spatial pooler and temporal memory networks could be reproduced based on \gls{adex} neurons.

Adapting the \gls{htm}'s plasticity rules

Analog neuromorphic hardware is susceptible to transistor mismatches due to e.g. dopand fluctuations in the production process. A careful calibration of the individual neurons is required to compensate for these variations. Due to the complexity of the problem and the high number of interdependent variables, a perfect calibration is hard to accomplish. Therefore, network models are required to be tolerant regarding certain spatial, and trial-to-trial variations on the computing substrate. Carrying out additional Monte Carlo simulations with slightly randomized parameters is important to investigate the robustness of the presented networks.

Finally, a multicompartmental neuron model is planned for a later version of the neurmorphic platform. Making use of this extended feature set will increase the level of biophysical detail.
