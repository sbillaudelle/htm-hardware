Implementing machine intelligence algorithms as spiking neural networks and porting them to a neuromorphic hardware platform presents high demands in terms of precision and scalability.

We have shown in this paper, that \glspl{htm} can be successfully modeled in dynamic simulations. The basic functionality of spatial pooler and temporal memory networks could be reproduced based on \gls{adex} neurons.

Adapting the \gls{htm}'s plasticity rules

Analog neuromorphic hardware is susceptible to transistor mismatches due to e.g. dopand fluctuations. A careful calibration of the individual neurons is required to compensate these variations. Due to the complexity of the problem and the high number of interdependent variables, a perfect calibration is hard to accomplish. Network models are required to be tolerant regarding certain variations from neuron to neuron. Carrying out additional Monte Carlo simulations with slightly randomized parameters is important to further investigate the robustness of the presented networks.

Finally, the level of biophysical realism in the \gls{htm} emulations will be increased by making use of the multicompartmental neuron model planned for a later version of the neuromorphic platform.
