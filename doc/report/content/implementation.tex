	\caption{Implementation of the spatial pooling algorithms. Columns \emph{C} are implemented utilizing a single neuron, while the inhibitory pool \emph{I} is modeled as a population consisting of e.g. 5 neurons. Projection \protect\circled{green}{1} represents the sparse excitatory connection from the input vector to the columns. At the same time, the global inhibitory pool is stimulated through forward connections \protect\circled{green}{2} from the source vector. Thus, the columns' overall activity is limited by this feed forward inhibition \protect\circled{green}{3}. A recurrent self-excitation \protect\circled{green}{4} facilitates enduring activation of single columns. A lateral inhibition with a predefined radius \protect\circled{green}{5} fosters a sparse column activity.}

A static version of the spatial pooler can be implemented as a self-normalizing competitive neural network, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:static_spatial_pooler}. Each column is represented by a single cell which is stimulated by a random subset of the input vector's bits. Active columns inhibit their neighbors within a radius $r_\text{inh}$. This lateral inhibition leads to a sparse activation of columns. At the same time, active columns recurrently stimulate themselves and thus try to stay in their active state.

Furthermore, a feed-forward inhibition was added to the network. An inhibitory cell pool collects events from the input vector as a whole. Thus, the pool's activity correlates directly with the number of active input bits. Inhibitory projections to the individual columns dampens the their activity and therefore limits the number of active columns.

In contrast to previous, purely software-based implementations, this model is not based on discrete computational steps. Instead, the continuous simulation is artificially divided into time steps of period $T_\text{step}$. A cell's or column's active state is defined by a series of spikes within a time step. This \emph{rate coding}-based approach limits the amount of information carried by a single event and thus should improve the noise resistance of the model. Similarly, the state of the input vector must be translated into spike trains. Each bit of the vector is assigned an individual spike source. For a true bit, the corresponding source emits a spike train of frequency $\nu_\text{stim}$. False bits are represented by a silent source. To avoid synchronization of the network, random jitter is added to the individual spike times.

The implementation's default parameters are summarized in table~\ref{tab:static_spatial_pooler_defaults}. The spatial pooler's basic properties were verified with the given parameter set.

The basic properties of the spatial pooler were verified for this implementation. For this purpose, the model was instantiated with 1000 columns and an input vector of length 2000\footnote{The limited input vector size is a result of the trade-off between the model's fidelity and the simulation's run time.}.

In a first scenario, input patterns with overlap scores between 0.0 and 1.0 were presented to the network. The overlap score of the column's activity patterns was calculated and plotted against the corresponding input scores. As shown in figure~\ref{fig:static_spatial_pooler_overlap}, …

In order to verify a sparse column activity, the network was stimulated with input data of varying sparsity. As a response, the number of active columns stayed the same for a wide range of active input bits, as is depicted in figure~\ref{fig:static_spatial_pooler_sparsity}.

	\caption{Spike timing based implementation of a spatial pooler. Each column is represented by a single cell \emph{c} and receives sparse input \protect\circled{green}{1} from the input vector. Dependinding on the number of connected active input bits, a column reaches its firing threshold after a certain delay: cells receiving a higher number of presynaptic events will reach that threshold earlier. The inhibitory pool \emph{I} accumulates the number of active columns on its membrane \protect\circled{green}{2}. After a predifined number of active columns, the cell inhibits all columns \protect\circled{green}{3}.}

	\caption{Implementation of the temporal memory not including plasticity. Every HTM cell within a column is modeled with three individual LIF cells modelling different compartments (distal dendrites \emph{D}, soma \emph{S} and a lateral inhibition segment \emph{I} -- which is not biologically inspired). Per column, there exist multiple cell triples as well as one ``head'' cell \emph{P} which participates in the columnar competition and collects proximal input for the whole column. Activity of this cell is forwarded to the individual soma cells of the column \protect\circled{green}{1}. Without a previous prediction, this results in all soma cells fireing. However, the distal compartment sums over the input of the previous time step. With a threshold being reached, the inhibitory compartment is depolarized by forwarding an event on \protect\circled{green}{3}. Together with proximal input \protect\circled{green}{2}, the inhibitory partition fires and inhibits all other cells in the column \protect\circled{green}{4}.}
