An intermediate step of emulating \gls{htm} networks on a neuromorphic hardware substrate one needs to set up and tweak a approriate models. For the analog neuromorphic hardware system considered in this report, these networks need to be based on the \gls{lif} or \gls{adex} neuron models. In the following sections, I will propose a spatial pooler as well as a temporal memory that fulfills such requirements.

\subsection{Spatial Pooler}
\label{sss:spatial_pooler_network}

\begin{figure*}

	\caption{Timing based implementation of the spatial pooler. Each column is represented by a single cell \emph{C} and receives sparse input from the input vector \protect\circled{green}{1}. The columns become active when the number of connected active inputs crosses a threshold. The rise time of the membrane voltage highly depends on the number of coincident inputs: cells with more presynaptic activity will fire before those with less stimuli do. Inhibitory pool \emph{I} accumulates the columnar spikes \protect\circled{green}{2} and in doing so acts as a counter. After a certain number of columns have become active, the pool will inhibit and shut down all columns preventing any further activity \protect\circled{green}{3}. To stabilize this \gls{kwta} model, all columns receive a subsampled feed-forward inhibition \protect\circled{green}{4}. This effectively prolongs the decision period for high input activity.}
	\label{fig:spatial_pooler}
\end{figure*}

At its core the spatial pooler resembles a \gls{kwta} network: $k$ out of $n$ columns are chosen to be active in each time step. In fact, \gls{kwta} networks have often been mentioned as an approximation for circuits naturally occurring in the neocortex \citep{felch2008hypergeometric}. While this topic has been discussed broadly in literature and continuous-time as well as VLSI implementations were investigated \citep{erlanson1991analog,tymoshchuk2012,maass2000neural}, the requirements which lead to this particular solution go beyond the discussed network architectures.

The network presented in figure~\ref{fig:spatial_pooler} follows a purely timing-based approach and is designed for \gls{lif} neurons. It allows for very fast decision processes based on a single input event per source. Each column is represented by a single cell which accumulates feed-forward input from the spike sources. Here, the rise time of the membrane voltage decreases with the number of presynaptic events seen by the cell: cells receiving the most input will fire before the others. An inhibitory pool consisting of a single cell collects the network's activity. Low membrane and high synaptic time constants lead to a reliable summation of events. When a certain number of spikes have been collected -- and thus the cell's threshold has been crossed --, the pool strongly inhibits all cells of the network suppressing following spike events.

The model is extended by adding subtle feed-forward shunting inhibition. The inhibitory conductance increases with the overall input activity $\nu_\text{in}$. Since the reversal potential is configured to match the leakage potential, the conductance contributes to the leakage term

\begin{align*}
	g_\text{l}' &= g_\text{l} + g_\text{inh}(\nu_\text{in}).
\end{align*}
%
thus increasing the membrane time constant. This effectively slows down the neurons' responses and thus prolongs the decision period of the network.

Tie situations between columns receiving the same number of presynaptic events can be resolved by adding slight gaussian jitter to the weights of the excitatory feed-forward connections. This gives some columns structural advantages over other columns resulting in a slightly faster response to the same stimulus. By increasing the standard deviation $\sigma_\text{j}$ of the jitter, the selection can be blurred.

%The proposed \gls{kwta} architecture was developed with the spatial pooler's properties in mind. In the following paragraphs, the model's performance is examined and compared to the goals formulated in section~\ref{sec:spatial_pooler_properties}.

\subsection{Temporal Memory}

Similar to the spatial pooler, the temporal memory implementation was designed for fast reaction times and spike-timing based response patterns. A complete network consists of $m$ identical columns with $n$ \gls{htm} cells each. Modelling these cells is a challange in itself. A multicompartmental neuron model would represent the best fit. While a neuromorphic hardware chip implementing such a model is planned and first steps in that direction have already been taken \citep{millner2012development}, the current system does not provide this feature. Since \gls{htm} cells primarily depend on the active properties of a compartment, it can be modelled by a tripled of individual \gls{lif} cells as shown in figure~\ref{fig:temporal_memory}.

\begin{figure*}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics{../circuitry/column.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Implementation of the temporal memory not including plasticity. Every HTM cell within a column is modeled with three individual LIF cells modeling different compartments (distal dendrites \emph{D}, soma \emph{S} and a lateral inhibition segment \emph{I} -- which is not biologically inspired). Per column, there exist multiple cell triples as well as one ``head'' cell \emph{P} which participates in the columnar competition and collects proximal input for the whole column. Activity of this cell is forwarded to the individual soma cells of the column \protect\circled{green}{1}. Without a previous prediction, this results in all soma cells firing. However, the distal compartment sums over the input of the previous time step. When a threshold is reached, the inhibitory compartment as well as the soma are depolarized \protect\circled{green}{3} \protect\circled{green}{4}. Together with proximal input \protect\circled{green}{2}, the inhibitory partition fires and inhibits all other cells in the column \protect\circled{green}{5}.}
	\label{fig:temporal_memory}
\end{figure*}

A column collects proximal input using a single cell. In fact, this cell can be part of a spatial pooler network as presented in section~\ref{sss:spatial_pooler_network}. When the column becomes active, this cell emits a spike and excites both, the neurons representing the \gls{htm} cells' somae as well as inhibitory helper cells. The latter projection is not strong enough to activate the target compartment alone. Instead, it only leads to a partial depolarization. The soma neuron, however, reaches the firing threshold for a single presynaptic event. This already suffices for a columnar bursting mechanism: without predictive input, all soma compartments will fire as a response to the proximal stimulus.

Distal input is processed for each cell individually by their dendritic segment compartments. A cell's dendritic segment receives input from other cells' somae. In case it's firing threshold is crossed, it partly depolarizes the inhibitory helper cell of the same triplet. This synaptic projection is set up with a relatively long synaptic time constant and a reversal potential matching the threshold voltage. This ensures that the predictive state is applied during the next time step and prohibits the cell from becoming active due to distal input alone. On proximal input, the already depolarized helper cell fires before the somatic compartments. The latter are then inhibited instantly, with the exception of the own triplet's soma. This basic predictive mechanism fails when multiple cells are predicted, since the inhibitory compartments laterally inhibit every cell. By also depolarizing the somatic compartments of predicted cells, this issue can be solved.

Each of these cells is represented by a somatic compartment, an inhibitory helper cells and two dendritic segments. The column is activated by proximal input in every time step and receives random distal stimulus predicting none, one or more cells per step. As indicated by the automatic classification algorithm, the column exhibits a correct response pattern to these predictions.}
